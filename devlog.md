# Devlog

11/25/2024 Project Summary

I am creating a B-tree implementation project. So far, I understand that this involves:
- Using a node structure to store keys and values.
- Managing tree traversal, splitting, and merging operations.

Plans
- Build the core structure of the project using multiple Java files, each with specific responsibilities.
- Use this log to track development progress and challenges.
  
 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far I think I will create three file, one for the Node, this will hold all the node stuff and etc, next I will create a BTree this will implement a BTree and Finally I will create the Main where all
the main function like menu and stuff happen.
 
 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
 do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
 session?
This session or for today  I plan to code the node stuff, this seems to be the easiest, and next session I will code the BTree and then the main. Finally I will try to connect them together and hopefully by 
day 4 I should be able to finish, and If I have feel like I can do more I will try to finish the other part Too.
