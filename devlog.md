# Devlog

11/26/2024 Project Summary

I am creating a B-tree implementation project. So far, I understand that this involves:
- Using a node structure to store keys and values.
- Managing tree traversal, splitting, and merging operations.

Plans
- Build the core structure of the project using multiple Java files, each with specific responsibilities.
- Use this log to track development progress and challenges.
  
 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far I think I will create three file, one for the Node, this will hold all the node stuff and etc, next I will create a BTree this will implement a BTree and Finally I will create the Main where all
the main function like menu and stuff happen.
 
 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
 do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
 session?
This session or for today  I plan to code the node stuff, this seems to be the easiest, and next session I will code the BTree and then the main. Finally I will try to connect them together and hopefully by 
day 4 I should be able to finish, and If I have feel like I can do more I will try to finish the other part Too.

 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far adding the Node. java isn't too bad but the Node file implementations of node is work a bit differently then how I added it for my other classes, since with the project instruction it a bit confusing. But I think I finished it and might tweak stuff later if necssary but overall, I think i did okay. hopefully it run more smoothly next time

 session?

This session I have finished the Node file. I also starteed working on the BTreeindex.file and a Bit on the Main.  I have no idea how I will implement the BTreeIndex.file but I think going to just continue how i will regulary do the BTree,
then add and tweak some stuff later on.

 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far, I was coding the whole day and the BTreeIndex is 3/4 done. I now see fully the big picture on how to code this.
I think I will try to code everything even though it may not reach the function I want. I just want so have a skeleton and then I will tweak the functions that not fully likling to what i want. Basically code the basic function and code the rest later with more full details, that way I can see where I miss and etc.

 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
 do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
 session?

This session I have finished the 3/4 of the BTreeindex file . I added B-Tree overwritting the file, opening  existing B-tree file, Read and verify the header block,  Writes the header block to the file and B- Tree node to it block, Print the entire b-tree in order, and etc. Next session I will try to add input file into the B-tree, extrac all key, and try to finish the rest of the code.

 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far, I was coding the whole day and the BTreeIndex is now done.I am not too sure if it will have all the things I need but I feel like it should. I will continue testing and when I am done with all the file I will tweak anythings that is needed is more details. Other than that this project is coming in nicely

 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
 do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
 session? 

This session I have finished the  all of the BTreeindex file . I added input file into the B-tree, extracing  all key methods, closing the file, helpers methods and etc. Next I planning on the Main which I will add the Menu screen and a loop, and a option of the Users. This doesn't too bad but I  after that hopefully then I am finished if not I might have to readjust some of my BTree file, since majoriy of my code is there to see if I am missing anything but, Majority of the method should work or base the requirment and instruction that he gives. I mnight need to reread his instruction but everything looks good so far. It's seem like I should be able to finish this by saturday night if all things go well.

 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far,  I finished the Main.java. No new thoughts I just need to recheck every method and file to make sure it have all the necessary functions. I ran it and it seemsed it does but I need to recheck it again to make sure that it works. other than that It seems to go alrigjt

 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
 do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
 session? 

Today, I finished the Main.java file, I added the catach error, and I added the menu and the fuctions for some of it, some of the menu option are in the BTreeindex file. Like load and print. Other than that tomorrow, I will just check to make sure i have all the functions and if I feel like I do I will create a Read-Me file and that will be my last update log and finished it.

a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far,  I finished the everything No new thoughts I think i have everything right, i check the search, create, open, insert, search, quit, although, i not sure if the professor want the way how I program the extract and the search. I am glad that i finish the project before my finals start although it took half my thanksgiving break. I

 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What

Today, I finished the readme for this project and recheck all the methods and test it using mutiple use cases. I think i am going to sumbit it, tonight.
