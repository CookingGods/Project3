# Devlog

11/25/2024 Project Summary

I am creating a B-tree implementation project. So far, I understand that this involves:
- Using a node structure to store keys and values.
- Managing tree traversal, splitting, and merging operations.

Plans
- Build the core structure of the project using multiple Java files, each with specific responsibilities.
- Use this log to track development progress and challenges.
