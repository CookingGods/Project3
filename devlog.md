# Devlog

11/26/2024 Project Summary

I am creating a B-tree implementation project. So far, I understand that this involves:
- Using a node structure to store keys and values.
- Managing tree traversal, splitting, and merging operations.

Plans
- Build the core structure of the project using multiple Java files, each with specific responsibilities.
- Use this log to track development progress and challenges.
  
 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far I think I will create three file, one for the Node, this will hold all the node stuff and etc, next I will create a BTree this will implement a BTree and Finally I will create the Main where all
the main function like menu and stuff happen.
 
 b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
 do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
 session?
This session or for today  I plan to code the node stuff, this seems to be the easiest, and next session I will code the BTree and then the main. Finally I will try to connect them together and hopefully by 
day 4 I should be able to finish, and If I have feel like I can do more I will try to finish the other part Too.

 a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session?
So far adding the Node. java isn't too bad but the Node file implementations of node is work a bit differently then how I added it for my other classes, since with the project instruction it a bit confusing. But I think I finished it and might tweak stuff later if necssary but overall, I think i did okay. hopefully it run more smoothly next time

This session I have finished the Node file. I also starteed working on the BTreeindex.file and a Bit on the Main.  I have no idea how I will implement the BTreeIndex.file but I think going to just continue how i will regulary do the BTree,
then add and tweak some stuff later on.
